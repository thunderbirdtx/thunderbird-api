## Docker Setup

To run the Thunderbird API locally with Docker and Redis:

### 1. Build and Start

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:
- `api`: the Express API (port 3001)
- `redis`: for background job queues
- `db`: PostgreSQL (optional, if using Prisma with Postgres)

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or use `docker-compose`:

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/thunderbird
THUNDERBIRD_DEBUG=true
```

### 3. Prisma Setup (if using Postgres)

Update your `schema.prisma`:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native", "debian-openssl-3.0.x"]
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

##  Running Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

### Run All Tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Lint Before Push (recommended)

```bash
npm run lint
```

Linting uses ESLint and checks the `src/` and `__tests__/` folders. CI runs both lint and tests on every push to `main`.

To enable logging for test debugging:

```bash
THUNDERBIRD_DEBUG=true npm test
```
